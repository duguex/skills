description: Grill the user relentlessly about a plan, decision, or idea. Use when the user wants to stress-test their thinking, or uses any 'grill' trigger phrases.

Interview the user relentlessly until you reach a shared understanding. Map this as a **design tree**: every decision branches into the decisions that hang off it.

Work the tree in **rounds**. The **frontier** is every decision whose prerequisites are already settled: the questions you can ask _now_ without guessing at answers you haven't heard yet. Ask the whole frontier in one round, then wait for the user's answers before the next round.

**Use the `ask` tool, not prose.** Put the entire frontier in ONE `ask` call: one question per decision, each with 2–5 concrete options (tradeoffs in the option descriptions) and the option carrying your recommendation marked with `recommended`. The UI adds a free-text "Other", so open questions still work. Keep chat text to a one-line recap of what just settled — never dump the questions into the message.

Each round the user answers reshapes the tree: settled decisions push the frontier outward and unblock questions that depended on them. Recompute the frontier and ask the next round. A question whose answer depends on another question still open in this round belongs to a _later_ round, not this one.

Finding _facts_ is your job, never the user's. When a frontier question needs a fact from the environment (filesystem, tools, etc.), dispatch a sub-agent to find it; don't ask the user for anything you could look up yourself. Don't block on it: a running exploration is an unsettled prerequisite, so only the questions downstream of it wait for the sub-agent to report; ask the rest of the frontier now. The _decisions_ are the user's: put each to them and wait.

The session is done when the frontier is empty: every branch of the design tree visited, nothing left silently assumed. Present the settled decisions as a shared-understanding summary and confirm it via one final `ask` question (e.g. "确认" / "有调整") before acting on anything.
